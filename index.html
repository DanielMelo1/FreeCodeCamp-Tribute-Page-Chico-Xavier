                <h3 id="subtitle-01">Childhood and youth</h3>
                <p>Son of worker João Cândido Xavier and washerwoman Maria João de Deus, he lost his mother when he was
                    five years old.</p>

                <p>His father was forced to hand over some of his nine children to the care of friendly people and Chico
                    Xavier was left in the care of his godmother, a nervous woman who cruelly mistreated him.</p>

                <p>Several times, Chico heard his late mother say that he would send an angel to reunite the whole
                    family. His father's second wife reunited all his siblings and had five more children.</p>

                <p>Chico Xavier began to have dreams and during the night he got up agitated and talked with the
                    spirits. In the morning, he would tell his dreams to his family. The father decided to take him to
                    the vicar of Matozinhos who, after listening to him, recommended that the boy no longer read
                    newspapers, magazines and books. I told him that no one comes back after death.</p>

                <p>When talking to his mother, sad for not being understood by anyone, Chico heard from her that he
                    needed to change his thoughts, that he should not be an undisciplined child, so as not to earn
                    dislike from others. He should learn to be silent and, when he remembers some lesson or experience
                    received in a dream, he should follow it.</p>


                <p>I told him that he needed to learn obedience so that God would one day grant him the trust of others.
                    For 7 consecutive years, from 1920 to 1927, he had no further contact with his mother.</p>

                <h3 id="subtitle">Here's a time line of Chico Xavier life:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>1910</strong> - Born in Pedro Leopoldo, Minas Gerais</li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>1914</strong> - At the age of 4, he already saw and heard the spirits and talked with
                        them.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>1925</strong> - The first and only teacher of Chico who discovered his psychographic
                        mediumship was D. Rosália, who would take field trips with the students and the next day they
                        would have to submit an essay describing the trip. Chico's always took first place.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>1927</strong> - One of his sisters fell ill and a spiritist couple met with his family
                        and held the first spiritist session which took place at Chico Xavier's house in Pedro Leopoldo.

                        On the table were two books, "The Gospel According to Spiritism" and "The Spirits' Book", by
                        Allan Kardec. Chico heard from his mother: "My son, behold, we are together again. The books in
                        front of us are two treasures of light. Study them, fulfill your duties and soon divine goodness
                        will allow us to show you your new ways".
                    <li>
                        <strong>1938</strong> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson.
                        Gets laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman,
                        he returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him about
                        breeding pest-resistent plants.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>1932</strong> - His first psychographed book, “Parnaso de Além-Túmulo”, which brings
                        together 256 poems, attributed to dead poets, was published in July 1932. In 1950, Chico Xavier
                        had already psychographed more than 50 books.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>1959</strong> - Under the guidance of Spiritual Benefactors, on January 5, 1959, Chico
                        Xavier moved to Uberaba, starting on that same date his mediumship activities, in a public
                        meeting of the “Christian Spiritist Communion”.

                        At that time, the famous pilgrimage began. On Saturdays, leaving the "Spiritist-Christian
                        Communion", the medium visited some needy homes, bringing them the joy of his friendly presence
                        accompanied by a large number of people. The city of Uberaba has become a center of attraction
                        for countless visitors from the most varied regions of Brazil and even abroad.
